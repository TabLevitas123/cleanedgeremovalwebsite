# Phase 2 Summary: Dependencies and Configuration

## Overview
In Phase 2, we established the foundational configuration for the Clean Edge Removal LLC website project. This phase focused on setting up the project structure, defining dependencies, and creating the necessary configuration files for development, testing, and production environments.

## Completed Tasks

### Project Structure
- Established a monorepo structure with client, server, and shared packages
- Created package.json files for the root project and each package
- Set up TypeScript configurations for all packages
- Configured build tools and development environments

### Frontend Configuration
- Set up Webpack for bundling and optimization
- Configured Tailwind CSS for styling
- Set up Jest for testing
- Configured ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Created basic HTML template and web app manifest

### Backend Configuration
- Configured Node.js and Express.js environment
- Set up MongoDB connection configuration
- Configured ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Set up Jest for testing

### Shared Configuration
- Set up TypeScript configuration for shared code
- Configured ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Set up Jest for testing

### API Planning
- Defined RESTful API endpoints following Richardson Maturity Model Level 3
- Planned authentication and authorization flows
- Designed rate limiting and security measures

### Data Modeling
- Designed MongoDB schema for all collections
- Defined relationships between collections
- Planned indexing strategy for performance optimization

## Key Configuration Files Created
- Root package.json and tsconfig.json
- Client, server, and shared package.json files
- Client, server, and shared tsconfig.json files
- Webpack configuration for frontend
- Tailwind CSS configuration
- ESLint and Prettier configurations for all packages
- Jest configurations for testing
- Basic HTML template and web manifest

## Next Steps
Moving into Phase 3, we will begin implementing the core functionality of the application:
1. Create the frontend components following the component hierarchy
2. Implement the backend API endpoints
3. Set up the database models and connections
4. Implement authentication and authorization
5. Develop the scheduling and appointment management features
6. Create the administrative portal
7. Implement the employee portal
8. Set up integration services
9. Implement comprehensive testing
10. Prepare for deployment

Each of these steps will be broken down into smaller tasks in the Phasechecklist.txt file.
