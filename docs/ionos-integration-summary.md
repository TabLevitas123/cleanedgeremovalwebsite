# IONOS Integration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to integrate IONOS services into the Clean Edge Removal LLC website project, replacing the originally planned AWS services.

## Overview of Changes

The following changes were made to integrate IONOS services:

1. Created IONOS configuration files
2. Updated email service to use IONOS SMTP
3. Created deployment scripts for IONOS hosting
4. Updated environment variables for IONOS services
5. Added documentation for IONOS integration

## Detailed Changes

### 1. IONOS Configuration

Created a new configuration file for IONOS services:

- `server/src/config/ionos.ts` - Configuration for IONOS services including email, hosting, domain, and DNS

This configuration file loads environment variables for IONOS services and provides default values when environment variables are not set.

### 2. Email Service

Updated the email service to use IONOS SMTP instead of AWS SES:

- `server/src/services/ionosEmail.service.ts` - Email service using IONOS SMTP
- `server/src/__tests__/services/ionosEmail.service.test.ts` - Tests for the IONOS email service

The email service provides methods for sending transactional emails, marketing emails, and handling email delivery feedback.

### 3. Deployment Configuration

Created deployment configuration and scripts for IONOS hosting:

- `server/src/config/deployment.ts` - Deployment configuration for different environments
- `scripts/deploy-ionos.js` - Deployment script for IONOS hosting

The deployment script uses FTP to upload the application to IONOS hosting. It supports both staging and production environments.

### 4. Environment Variables

Updated environment variables for IONOS services:

- `.env.example` - Example environment variables file with IONOS configuration

Added the following environment variables:

```
# IONOS Email Configuration
IONOS_EMAIL_HOST=smtp.ionos.com
IONOS_EMAIL_PORT=587
IONOS_EMAIL_SECURE=false
IONOS_EMAIL_USER=your-email@cleanedgeremoval.com
IONOS_EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password
IONOS_EMAIL_FROM=noreply@cleanedgeremoval.com
IONOS_EMAIL_REPLY_TO=info@cleanedgeremoval.com

# IONOS Hosting Configuration
IONOS_FTP_HOST=ftp.ionos.com
IONOS_FTP_PORT=21
IONOS_FTP_USER=your-ftp-username
IONOS_FTP_PASSWORD=your-ftp-password
IONOS_FTP_ROOT_DIR=/cleanedgeremoval

# IONOS Database Configuration
IONOS_DB_HOST=db.ionos.com
IONOS_DB_PORT=27017
IONOS_DB_USER=your-db-username
IONOS_DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
IONOS_DB_NAME=cleanedgeremoval

# IONOS Domain Configuration
IONOS_PRIMARY_DOMAIN=cleanedgeremoval.com
IONOS_SUBDOMAIN_WWW=true
IONOS_SUBDOMAIN_ADMIN=true
IONOS_SUBDOMAIN_API=true

# IONOS DNS Configuration
IONOS_DNS_API_KEY=your-dns-api-key
IONOS_DNS_API_SECRET=your-dns-api-secret
IONOS_DNS_ZONE_ID=your-dns-zone-id
```

### 5. Integration Services Documentation

Updated the integration services documentation to reflect IONOS services:

- `integration-services.md` - Updated to include IONOS services
- `docs/ionos-integration-guide.md` - Detailed guide for IONOS integration

The integration services documentation now includes a section on IONOS services, including domain management, hosting configuration, email integration, and DNS configuration.

### 6. Package Dependencies

Added dependencies for IONOS integration:

- `basic-ftp` - FTP client for deployment
- `chalk` - Terminal styling for deployment script
- `commander` - Command-line interface for deployment script
- `archiver` - File archiving for deployment
- `handlebars` - Email template rendering
- `winston-daily-rotate-file` - Log rotation for Winston logger

## Migration from AWS to IONOS

The following AWS services were replaced with IONOS equivalents:

| AWS Service | IONOS Equivalent |
|-------------|------------------|
| AWS SES | IONOS Email |
| AWS EC2 | IONOS Web Hosting |
| AWS S3 | IONOS Web Storage |
| AWS CloudFront | IONOS CDN (if available) |
| AWS Route 53 | IONOS DNS |

## Deployment Changes

The deployment process has been updated to use IONOS hosting:

1. Build the application with `npm run build`
2. Deploy to IONOS hosting with `npm run deploy:ionos:staging` or `npm run deploy:ionos:production`

The deployment script handles:
- Uploading the client build to the web root directory
- Uploading the server build to the API directory
- Uploading configuration files
- Setting up the environment

## Testing

Tests have been added for the IONOS email service to ensure it works correctly. The tests mock the external dependencies to avoid actual API calls during testing.

## Future Considerations

1. **CDN Integration**: Consider using IONOS CDN if available for improved performance
2. **Automated Deployment**: Explore options for automated deployment with IONOS
3. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for IONOS services
4. **Backup Strategy**: Implement a backup strategy for IONOS hosting
5. **SSL Certificates**: Ensure SSL certificates are properly configured for all domains and subdomains
